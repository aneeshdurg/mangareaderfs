# mangareaderfs
A file system interface to mangareader.net, written using fusepy

creating or deleting a new folder will repectively add/delete entries from the reading list

If a manga name is not found, an attempt will be made to see if the name is actually an alternate name of another manga. (e.g. Tokyo Ghoul is listed as Toukyo Kushu on mangareader).
